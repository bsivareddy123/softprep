Line They operate somewhere between order and disorder‚Äîon the edge of chaos, in(5) the phrase of the computer scientist Christopher Langton. Such systems can appear to operate quite stably for some time; they seem to be in equilibrium but are, in fact, constantly adapting. But there comes a moment when complex systems 'go critical.' A very small trigger can set off a 'phase transition' from a benign equilibrium to a crisis‚Äîa single grain of sand causes a whole pile to collapse, or a butterfly flaps its (10) wings in the Amazon and brings about a hurricane in southeastern England. Not long after such crises happen, historians arrive on the scene. They are the scholars who specialize in the study of 'fat tail' events‚Äîthe low-frequency, high-impact moments that inhabit the tails of probability distributions, such as wars, revolutions, financial crashes, and imperial collapses. But historians often misun- (15) derstand complexity in decoding these events. They are trained to explain calamity in terms of long-term causes, often dating back decades. This is what Nassim Taleb rightly condemned in The Black Swan as 'the narrative fallacy': the construction of psychologically satisfying stories on the principle of post hoc, ergo propter hoc. Drawing casual inferences about causation is an age-old habit. Take World War I. (20) A huge war breaks out in the summer of 1914, to the great surprise of nearly every-one. Before long, historians have devised a story line commensurate with the disas-ter: a treaty governing the neutrality of Belgium that was signed in 1839, the waning of Ottoman power in the Balkans dating back to the 1870s, and malevolent Germans and the navy they began building in 1897. A contemporary version of this fallacy (25) traces the 9/11 attacks back to the Egyptian government's 1966 execution of Sayyid Qutb, the Islamist writer who inspired the Muslim Brotherhood. Most recently, the financial crisis that began in 2007 has been attributed to measures of financial deregulation taken in the United States in the 1980s.

            "name": "An 'ideal' cinder cone forms when eruption occurs on flat ground. From deep within the Earth, magma charged with gas (like a carbonated drink) rises through a vertical pipe-shaped conduit and erupts as a fountain of frothy lava that may spray Line as high as 2,000 feet into the air. As an individual blob of this frothy molten rock flies (5) through the air, it cools quickly enough to solidify before falling back to Earth. Many gas bubbles remain trapped in the fragments. If small, these fragments of rock are called 'cinders,' and if larger, 'bombs.' As eruption continues, cinders accumulate to form a conical hill. Periodically, the flanks of the growing hill may become so steep that lobes and sheets of cinders slide downward. When lava fountaining ends, a sym - (10) metrical cone-shaped hill, commonly indented by a summit crater, has been added to the landscape. Internally, the cone is a pile of loose cinders in layers that dip away from the volcano's vent in all directions. During the waning stage of an ideal cinder-cone eruption, the magma has lost most of its gas content. This gasdepleted magma does not fountain but oozes qui- (15) etly into the crater or beneath the base of the cone as lava. Because it contains so few gas bubbles, the molten lava is denser than the bubble-rich cinders. Thus, it burrows out along the bottom of the cinder cone, lifting the less-dense cinders like a cork on water, and advances outward, creating a lava flow around the cone's base. When the eruption ends, a symmetrical cone of cinders sits at the center of a surrounding pad (20) of lava. Field studies conducted by U.S. Geological Survey and Northern Arizona Univer-sity scientists suggest that Red Mountain grew on a nearly flat surface that may have sloped gently to the north. However, little else about this volcano mimics the fea-tures of an ideal cinder cone. When viewed from above, Red Mountain is a U-shaped (25) landform open to the west, rather than a symmetrical cone. The base of the U is a curving ridge that forms the highest part of the mountain. The nearly half-milelong arms of the U slope down to the west and merge with the gently rolling surface of the Red Mountain lava flow. By carefully measuring the orientation of cinder layers over all parts of Red (30) Mountain, geologists have mapped a radial pattern of layers, dipping away from the middle of the U in all directions. At the amphitheater, all the exposed layers dip uniformly to the northeast. This pattern indicates that the vent is somewhere in the middle of the U and not at the amphitheater The shape of Red Mountain and its overall pattern of cinder layers raises the (35) question of why a symmetrical cone was not created around the vent at the center of the U. Three possible explanations are: ‚Ä¢ If the lava-fountaining phase of eruption occurred during a time of sustained wind blowing from west to east, most cinders could have been blown eastward creating the asymmetrical shape of Red Mountain. However, eruptions of the type that (40) built Red Mountain usually last several years to a decade or longer, and it seems unlikely that a westerly wind could have persisted for such a period of time. ‚Ä¢ Perhaps the conduit through which magma rose to the surface was inclined eastward enough to give the same effect as a westerly wind, but this seems unlikely because the driving force for rising magma is the buoyancy of very hot volcanic (45) gases. Like a cork released in water, such gases tend to rise vertically rather than follow an inclined path. ‚Ä¢ The most likely possibility is that the waning-stage lava flow of the Red Mountain eruption rafted the western section of the cinder cone away, like wood on flowing water. When gas-poor molten lava burrows its way outward beneath a cinder cone, (50) it may either leave the cone undisturbed or carry pieces piggyback, literally floating pieces on the surface of the denser lava. Many examples of both situations are known worldwide; a spectacular example of rafting is found at Sunset Crater National Monument, northeast of Flagstaff. At Red Mountain, geologists have discovered several outcrops of layered cinder deposits, (25) some of which are hundreds of feet wide and tens of feet thick, at the top of the lava flow. Typically, these 'floaters' form hills on the surface of an otherwise fairly flat flow. Apparently, molten lava oozed out beneath the west base of Red Mountain and rafted away much of that side of the cinder cone, creating its U shape.",

            "name": "An 'ideal' cinder cone forms when eruption occurs on flat ground. From deep within the Earth, magma charged with gas (like a carbonated drink) rises through a vertical pipe-shaped conduit and erupts as a fountain of frothy lava that may spray Line as high as 2,000 feet into the air. As an individual blob of this frothy molten rock flies (5) through the air, it cools quickly enough to solidify before falling back to Earth. Many gas bubbles remain trapped in the fragments. If small, these fragments of rock are called 'cinders,' and if larger, 'bombs.' As eruption continues, cinders accumulate to form a conical hill. Periodically, the flanks of the growing hill may become so steep that lobes and sheets of cinders slide downward. When lava fountaining ends, a sym - (10) metrical cone-shaped hill, commonly indented by a summit crater, has been added to the landscape. Internally, the cone is a pile of loose cinders in layers that dip away from the volcano's vent in all directions. During the waning stage of an ideal cinder-cone eruption, the magma has lost most of its gas content. This gasdepleted magma does not fountain but oozes qui- (15) etly into the crater or beneath the base of the cone as lava. Because it contains so few gas bubbles, the molten lava is denser than the bubble-rich cinders. Thus, it burrows out along the bottom of the cinder cone, lifting the less-dense cinders like a cork on water, and advances outward, creating a lava flow around the cone's base. When the eruption ends, a symmetrical cone of cinders sits at the center of a surrounding pad (20) of lava. Field studies conducted by U.S. Geological Survey and Northern Arizona Univer-sity scientists suggest that Red Mountain grew on a nearly flat surface that may have sloped gently to the north. However, little else about this volcano mimics the fea-tures of an ideal cinder cone. When viewed from above, Red Mountain is a U-shaped (25) landform open to the west, rather than a symmetrical cone. The base of the U is a curving ridge that forms the highest part of the mountain. The nearly half-milelong arms of the U slope down to the west and merge with the gently rolling surface of the Red Mountain lava flow. By carefully measuring the orientation of cinder layers over all parts of Red (30) Mountain, geologists have mapped a radial pattern of layers, dipping away from the middle of the U in all directions. At the amphitheater, all the exposed layers dip uniformly to the northeast. This pattern indicates that the vent is somewhere in the middle of the U and not at the amphitheater The shape of Red Mountain and its overall pattern of cinder layers raises the (35) question of why a symmetrical cone was not created around the vent at the center of the U. Three possible explanations are: ‚Ä¢ If the lava-fountaining phase of eruption occurred during a time of sustained wind blowing from west to east, most cinders could have been blown eastward creating the asymmetrical shape of Red Mountain. However, eruptions of the type that (40) built Red Mountain usually last several years to a decade or longer, and it seems unlikely that a westerly wind could have persisted for such a period of time. ‚Ä¢ Perhaps the conduit through which magma rose to the surface was inclined eastward enough to give the same effect as a westerly wind, but this seems unlikely because the driving force for rising magma is the buoyancy of very hot volcanic (45) gases. Like a cork released in water, such gases tend to rise vertically rather than follow an inclined path. ‚Ä¢ The most likely possibility is that the waning-stage lava flow of the Red Mountain eruption rafted the western section of the cinder cone away, like wood on flowing water. When gas-poor molten lava burrows its way outward beneath a cinder cone, (50) it may either leave the cone undisturbed or carry pieces piggyback, literally floating pieces on the surface of the denser lava. Many examples of both situations are known worldwide; a spectacular example of rafting is found at Sunset Crater National Monument, northeast of Flagstaff. At Red Mountain, geologists have discovered several outcrops of layered cinder deposits, (25) some of which are hundreds of feet wide and tens of feet thick, at the top of the lava flow. Typically, these 'floaters' form hills on the surface of an otherwise fairly flat flow. Apparently, molten lava oozed out beneath the west base of Red Mountain and rafted away much of that side of the cinder cone, creating its U shape.",
